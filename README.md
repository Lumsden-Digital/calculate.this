# Calculate.This

> Open source project, inviting new and aspiring developers to contribute.

The goal is to get developers working as part of a team, with code they have not written along with gaining experience of version control, more specifically making forks and raising pull requests.

We invite you to design a simple utility calculator, and implement as a new page within the site. There is an endless list of options to choose from.

## FAQ

- What files do I need to add?

  - You should only need to add two files.
    First, make a copy of `template.html` and rename to the function of your caclulator. e.g. `mortgagecalculator.html`
  - You will also need a file for your Javascript. Link to this file in your html file.

- How do I add a link to my page in the site?
  - In the `header.js` file, replace one of the `Your Calculator Here` anchor tags with your own link.
